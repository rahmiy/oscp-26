# Searching for Exploits

> 1. Identify products that have a history of problems. Identify products that are
typically hard to patch.

Products with a history of problems include things like Content Management Systems (e.g. Wordpress), Web Servers etc.

Products that are hard to patch are those that are *baked in* to an OS, or that do not have an auto-update function.

> 2. Look at the frequency of what sort of exploits are released. Can you identify
which types of exploits are more common than others?

Exploits tend to be released during major release cycles or when vulnerabilities are reported.

Remote exploits tend to be rarer than local ones.

> 3. Understand the difference between a reported vulnerability and an exploit.

A reported vulnerability is an issue in software that has been made publicly available and opens up a security weakness.

An exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability to perform an action that should not otherwise be allowed.
