# Vulnerability Scanning Exercises

> 1. Use nmap scripts and OpenVAS to conduct targeted scans (against single hosts)
against systems in your target network.
> 2. Account for the traffic using iptables. How many resources does scanning a
single host require, in terms of network bandwidth, and time?
> 3. Consider the sort of vulnerabilities a scanner will identify. What are the
limitations of the tool? Why?

```bash
# Use nmap scripts to scan for vulnerable HTTP servers
nmap 192.168.0.1 -p 80,443 --open --scripts http*vuln*.nse
```

## Traffic Statistics

```bash
iptables -L

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

# Create a new chain and forward traffic to it
iptables -N traffic_stats
iptables -I FORWARD -j traffic_stats

# Break the traffic down by protocol
iptables -A traffic_stats -p tcp
iptables -A traffic_stats -p udp
iptables -A traffic_stats -p icmp
```

## Limitations of VS

* False positive and negatives rate
* Traffic generation
* Limited to remote vulnerabilities for the most part
